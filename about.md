## O hai! Iâ€™m Michael D. Mathew.

But most people just call me Mike. Iâ€™m a developer/designer & musician based out of the Dallas/Fort Worth area. I like to make pretty things that help people. For the last two years (and counting) I have worked as a software engineer at Call-Em-All in Frisco, TX. I also help organize the [ReactJS Dallas software meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Dallas/). I am a graduate of the (former) code school in Austin, Texas called [The Iron Yard](http://www.theironyard.com/). Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working with clients like many high school band programs in Texas to develop websites including North Mesquite HS, Crandall HS, DeSoto HS, Trinity HS, and Midlothian HS.

As a longtime musician and music educator I have worked with some terrific programs as a performer and teacher. The list is long but includes such powerhouses as Texas A&M University-Commerce, Berkner High School, North Mesquite High School, Trinity High School, Forney High School, Texas Christian University, University of Texas at Arlington, and several others all over the state of Texas. I am an Innovative Percussion artist and Pearl/Adams Educational Artist. Also, I continue to ardently support all things [DCI](http://www.dci.org/) and [Lone Star Percussion](http://www.lonestarpercussion.com/). On occasion I can be seen hitting drums or marimbas or timpani and sometimes even get to write music for other people and groups. Thankfully, I do get to play drum set at church every weekend, so my funky beats haven't withered away.

My most important work is being husband to my lovely wife, father to my three wonderful children, and guardian for my little brother. I enjoy any good music, the Dallas Mavericks, ï£¿ computers and products, and the Oxford comma. ðŸ˜œ By night I stay up learning everything that I don't yet know, or I am reading about how I should be sleeping more. My family and friends are awesome and a continual blessing in my life.

I exist on Twitter as [@drumsensei](https://twitter.com/drumsensei), on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/drumsensei/), and on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/m2mathew). I also spend a bit of time in the terrific open-source awesomeness of [Github](https://github.com/m2mathew), too.

## Colophon

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which means most content was written using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). The former iteration of the site was a  [RapidWeaver](http://realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/) site. Hosting by DreamHost. Coding is done in Atom with generous assistance from the Chrome inspector. I use a 15" 2015 Retina MacBook Pro with a few meaningful stickers. It rules. As a constant learner, I will likely be poking and prodding here and there throughout this space, so it might not always look the same. Also, there is little guarantee that it will appear correctly on older browsers, so keep them up to date! I will do my best not to break it too much.

## Why drumsensei?

When I taught at Trinity High School I referred to my cymbal line as the "cymbal ninjas". They were an all-female, extremely intelligent, no-nonsense group of people. All of the extraordinary moves and sounds they made were superbly choreographed, and they did not put up with any halfway effort. After some interval of time, all of the students began to call me "sensei." So, naturally drumsensei comes from that.
