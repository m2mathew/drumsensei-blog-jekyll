## Building a gallery for images posted from users


We have spent the week learning how to simplify JavaScript down into jQuery (although, that is an oversimplification itself, in some ways). Then we learned how to connect to a server using AJAX, pushing information to the server and then learning how to retrieve it. When you put that information alongside the small projects we did all week like creating a login page and making a todo list, then creating an [Instagram](https://instagram.com) clone (albeit a smaller scale) is a logical outgrowth of that.

So, that is my goal for today and this weekend. If you need me, then I will be under the hood of Sublime Text reading some Input Mono and muttering to myself incomprehensibly.
