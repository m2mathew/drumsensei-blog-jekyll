Day 02 of [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/) has happened. I lived through it.

After learning several tidbits about CSS tricks and how to use floats and overflow, we had a daunting assignment. We were tasked to recreate the home page of [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/) in various stages.

Honest Abe, I was a bit stunned at such a complex project.

Copying others is useful to get deeper down into the "how" of any skill. For instance, in my undergraduate music education days, my percussion professor, the illustrious [Dr. Brian West](https://finearts.tcu.edu/faculty_staff/brian-a-west/), would require drumset students to listen to a song of our choosing and then transcribe the exact drumset part. We also had to perform it in front of our peers or in front of a panel of percussion teachers. This was time-consuming and difficult…and I loved it. I officially transcribed [Max Roach](http://www.drummerworld.com/drummers/Max_Roach.html), [Art Blakey](http://www.drummerworld.com/drummers/Art_Blakey.html), and [Billy Martin](http://www.drummerworld.com/drummers/Billy_Martin.html), all of which led me to many others to transcribe on my own.

Other things I learned today:
- How to use "em" versus "px" (though "rem" will be useful soon)
- Make boxes "float" left and right like a magnet
- More study of the CSS Box Model
- "box-sizing: border-box" (behavior which "[turns out](https://twitter.com/KarlVanHoet)" is from very old IE!)
- Using "git" in the shell to upload projects to GitHub
- Installing new packages in Sublime Text

I definitely did **not** finish the homework by 10:00 PM as expected. I looked up from feverishly typing and hitting ⌘-⇥ then ⌘-R, realized it was 10:00PM and 30 seconds, and then sent my work to GitHub lickety split. Alas, by the time I submitted my GItHub link to our instructor, it was definitely 10:01 PM (at least on my laptop).

Nonetheless, I continued to work on the layouts, and finished what was expected about 12:15 AM. It has been submitted. I can sleep a little.

There were still two spacing issues in my layout where text was out of alignment for about 5px. Annoying, but I will figure it out.

Oh, we also found out that [our instructor likes nutella](http://nutellahabit.com/)…perhaps it borders on obsession. Someone left an anonymous gift of a nutella snack-pack for him. Good move!

To Infinity and Beyond!
