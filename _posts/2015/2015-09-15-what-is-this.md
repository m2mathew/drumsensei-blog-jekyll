## JS Keyword "this"

Ok, things are about to get confusing. If you are not thinking clearly then go skip this and go read the facebooks or something. Maybe go take a walk.

Still here? **Well, let's talk about `this`...**

Just kidding. This is awesome. The easiest way to put this...erm, what I am trying to say is...the best way to get this down on paper...blurgh... Using this word seems nearly impossible!

In JavaScript we are often dealing with a small snippet of code that does a task. It is called a function. Inside that function we might be targeting a specific item that triggered an event. A shorthand way of talking about some information that is passed in to the function is to use the `this` keyword. It enables the programmer to talk about a generic piece of information without knowing exactly what it is ahead of time.

Specifically, `this` refers to the current DOM element, at least in the way that we have been using it in class. It is also useful when creating new objects with a constructor. I have not used it a ton just yet (only a couple of times), so I have yet to build up a lexicon of knowledge to disseminate to the masses about `this`.

If you want to learn more about `this`, then go to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) or just !google search it on [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=!google+this+in+javascript).
