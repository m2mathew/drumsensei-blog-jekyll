I am Mike Mathew, and you have stumbled into my corner of the interwebs. Welcome!

In the case that you don't know me, please go find my [About](/about) page and learn more there. If I already know you, then we should probably talk more often. Please send a text that reads: **`Let's do lunch`**

For a long, long while I have been meaning to get a space set up to make words appear on the internet.

Here it is.

It has arrived.

We have it now.

I foresee many posts forthcoming about both computer programming/coding and music/education and probably just life in general. I would very much appreciate any comments or correspondence you might care to share. As I become a worldwide internet sensation, I cannot guarantee a response in a timely manner. (Actually, I will probably be playing with my kids or reading a documentation file about something!)

I certainly do not purport to know all things, but I have a decent amount of wisdom and experience to share regarding some things. As a percussionist, I have some mastery over most of the domains. As a percussion teacher, I have a literal ton of experience across many skill levels and types of communities. As a coder/hacker, I am a unique wide-eyed newbie!

Let's get down to business. Next up is why I am switching careersâ€¦
